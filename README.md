# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The error occurs because the loop condition allows the index to exceed the valid range of indices for the array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The solution provides a corrected loop condition.
